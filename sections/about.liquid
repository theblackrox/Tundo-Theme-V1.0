      <a>Oriana Tundo, a Swiss native with italian-indian roots, is an Artist
        working in Jewelry and Objects. After operating as a freelance Designer
        she launched her eponymous brand TUNDO in 2022.The first collection is a
        series of repurposed Jewelry fetched all over the world, put together
        in a new way with functional pieces and chains, showing post consumed
        Jewelry in a new wearable way. Her background as a Chemistry Assistant
        and the Swiss metal industry takes a big influence throughout her work -
        Galvanized metal mixes with once-owned achievements and questions the
        decadence of mass consumption. By creating limited collections, TUNDO
        remains on the pulse of the times , keeping up with the constant rapid
        change in fashion, without loosing the identity. Every piece is handmade
        and unique.</a>
